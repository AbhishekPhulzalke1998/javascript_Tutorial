                His original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune.
                Eventually he became a successful sweet seller and a rich businessman. In the later 1800s, 
                they lost their only son in a plague epidemic. They were approached by a compassionate sage who advised
                them to build a Ganesha temple in Pune.</p>
