            <p class="para-style">Shivneri got its name as it was under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. 
                This fort was mainly used to guard the old trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan. The place passed on to the Bahmani Sultanate after
                 the weakening of Delhi Sultanate during the 15th century and it then passed on to the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in the 16th century. In 1595, a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhosale, 
                the grandfather of Shivaji Maharaj Bhosale, was ennobled by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan.</p>
