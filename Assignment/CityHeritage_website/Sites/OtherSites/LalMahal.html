                the latter's when he was trying to escape from the first-floor window of the Lal Mahal.[4] 
                This was part of a surreptitious guerrilla attack on the massive and entrenched Mughal Army that had camped in Pune, 
                with Shaista occupying (possibly symbolically) Shivaji's childhood home</p>
