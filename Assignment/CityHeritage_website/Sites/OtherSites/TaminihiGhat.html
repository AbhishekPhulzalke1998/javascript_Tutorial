            <p class="para-style">The Tamhini road ghat cuts the Sahyadri range to join Mulshi to Tamhini and makes the route in Konkan from Pune.
                 This ghat stretches almost 15 km. The road is now very good and newly laid. The entire stretch becomes a popular destination during the monsoons. During the rainy season, the place transforms into a green bed with many waterfalls and streams. 
                There are state buses which ply through the ghat connecting Pune city with places on the Goa highway (NH17).</p>
